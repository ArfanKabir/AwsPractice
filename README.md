# AwsPractice
Practice with AWS required for my internship at Thortech Industries in White Plains, New York over Summer 2019
These files found implement the use of the Boto3 module in Python, which allows the language to communicate with the AWS API
These programs implement uploading, and downloading files, which then can be used to analyze said files from the an S3 bucket, like the practice.py and awsTest.py programs show.
